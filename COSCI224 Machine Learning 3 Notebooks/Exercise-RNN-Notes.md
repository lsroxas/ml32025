### Code Explanation:

This code cell prepares the data for training, validation, and testing using PyTorch's `DataLoader`.

1.  **`from torch.utils.data import DataLoader`**: Imports the `DataLoader` class from PyTorch, which helps in efficiently loading data in batches during model training and evaluation.
2.  **`NUM_WORKERS = 6`**: Sets the number of subprocesses to use for data loading. Using multiple workers can speed up data loading by performing it in parallel.
3.  **Parameter Definitions**:
    *   `lookback = 10`: Specifies that each input sequence will consist of data from the previous 10 time steps (days, in this context).
    *   `step = 6`: Defines the sampling rate within the `lookback` window. It seems this intends to sample every 6th data point within the lookback period, but given the daily data, this might be intended differently (e.g., sampling every 6 hours if the data were hourly, or perhaps it's an error if the data is truly daily).
    *   `delay = 144 * 2`: Sets the prediction horizon. The model will predict the value 288 time steps (presumably days) after the end of the input sequence. This seems like a very long delay for daily data.
    *   `batch_size = 128`: Determines the number of samples (sequences) that will be processed together in each iteration during training or evaluation.
4.  **Dataset Creation (`TimeSeriesDataset`)**:
    *   Instances of the custom `TimeSeriesDataset` class (defined previously) are created for training, validation, and testing.
    *   `data2`: The input DataFrame (containing normalized GW values and dates).
    *   `lookback`, `delay`, `step`: Parameters defined above.
    *   `min_index`, `max_index`: These define the start and end row indices in `data2` for each dataset split. 
        *   **Note:** The indices used (0-200000 for train, 200001-300000 for validation, 300001+ for test) are extremely large compared to the actual size of `data2` (1581 rows). This will likely lead to errors or empty datasets because the `TimeSeriesDataset` logic will try to access indices far beyond the available data range. The splits should be based on the actual length of the data (e.g., using percentages or specific date cutoffs like Jan 2021 as requested).
5.  **DataLoader Creation**:
    *   `DataLoader` instances (`train_loader`, `val_loader`, `test_loader`) are created for each dataset.
    *   `batch_size`: Uses the defined batch size.
    *   `shuffle=True` (for `train_loader`): Randomly shuffles the training data in each epoch to prevent the model from learning the order of samples.
    *   `shuffle=False` (for `val_loader`, `test_loader`): Keeps the data order consistent for validation and testing, which is standard practice.
    *   `num_workers=NUM_WORKERS`: Uses the specified number of worker processes for loading.
