    "Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are a family of models that were inspired by how the **visual cortex of human brain** works when recognizing objects. The development of CNNs goes back to the 1990's, when Yann LeCun and his colleagues proposed a novel neural network architecture for classifying handwritten digits from images (Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network, Y LeCun, and others, 1989, published at Neural Information Processing Systems(NIPS) conference). Due to the outstanding performance of CNNs for image classification tasks, they have gained a lot of attention and this led to tremendous improvements in machine learning and computer vision applications.      \n",

    "\n",
    "Successfully **extracting salient (relevant) features** is key to the performance of any machine learning algorithm, of course, and traditional machine learning models rely on input features that may come from a domain expert, or are based on computational feature extraction techniques. Neural networks are able to automatically learn the features from raw data that are most useful for a particular task. For this reason, it's common to consider a neural network as a feature extraction engine: the **early layers** (those right after the input layer) extract **low level features**.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Multilayer neural networks, and in particular, deep convolutional neural networks, construct a so-called feature hierarchy by combining the low-level features in a layer-wise fashion to form high-level features. For example, if we're dealing with images, then low-level features, such as edges and blobs, are extracted from the earlier layers, which are combined together to form high-level features – as object shapes like a building, a car, or a dog.    \n",

    "- **Sparse-connectivity:** A single element in the feature map is connected to only a small patch of pixels. (This is very different from connecting to the whole input image, in the case of perceptrons. You may find it useful to look back and compare how we implemented a fully connected network that connected to the whole image.)    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter-sharing:** The same weights are used for different patches of the input image. As a direct consequence of these two ideas, the number of weights (parameters) in the network decreases dramatically, and we see an improvement in the ability to capture salient features. Intuitively, it makes sense that *nearby pixels are probably more relevant to each other* than pixels that are far away from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, CNNs are composed of *several Convolutional (conv)* layers and *subsampling (also known as Pooling (P))* layers that are followed by one or more Fully Connected (FC) layers at the end. The fully connected layers are essentially a multilayer perceptron, where every input unit $i$ is connected to every output unit $j$ with weight $w_{ij}$ (which we learned previously).\n",

    "## 2.1 Performing a discrete convolution in one dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some basic definitions and notations we are going to use. A discrete convolution for two one-dimensional vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ is denoted by $\\mathbf{y}= \\mathbf{x}*\\mathbf{w}$ , in which vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is our input (sometimes called signal) and $\\mathbf{w}$ is called the filter or kernel. A discrete convolution is mathematically defined as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{y}= \\mathbf{x} * \\mathbf{w} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{k=+\\infty} \\mathbf{x} [i-k] \\mathbf{w}[k]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the brackets [...] are used to denote the indexing for vector elements. The index $i$ runs through each element of the output vector $\\mathbf{y}$. There are two odd things in the preceding formula that we need to clarify: $−\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ indices and negative indexing for $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **first issue** where the **sum runs through indices from $−\\infty$ to $+\\infty$** seems odd mainly because in machine learning applications, we always deal with finite feature vectors. For example, if $\\mathbf{x}$ has 10 features with indices 0,1,2,…,8,9, then indices $−\\infty:-1$ and $10 : +\\infty$ are out of bounds for $\\mathbf{x}$. Therefore, to correctly compute the summation shown in the preceding formula, it is assumed that $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are filled with zeros. This will result in an output vector $\\mathbf{y}$ that also has infinite size with lots of zeros as well. Since this is not useful in practical situations, $\\mathbf{x}$ is padded only with a\n",
    "finite number of zeros.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **zero-padding** or simply **padding**. Here, the number of zeros padded on each side is denoted by *p*. An example padding of a one-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"670\" alt=\"zero-padding\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25600601/134187112-666edbe5-6e2f-4982-b01b-721ae3f53969.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the original input $\\mathbf{x}$ and filter $\\mathbf{w}$ have $n$ and $m$ elements, respectively, where $m \\leq n$. Therefore, the padded vector $\\mathbf{x}^p$  has size $n + 2p$. Then, the practical formula for computing a discrete convolution will change to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have solved the infinite index issue, the second issue is indexing $\\mathbf{x}$ with $i + m - k$. The important point to notice here is that $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are indexed in different directions in this summation. For this reason, we can flip one of those vectors, $\\mathbf{x}$ or $\\mathbf{w}$, after they are padded. Then, we can simply compute their dot product.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we flip the filter $\\mathbf{w}$ to get the rotated filter $\\mathbf{w}^r$ . Then, the dot product $\\mathbf{x}[i : i + m]$ $\\cdot$ $\\mathbf{w}^r$ is computed to get one element $\\mathbf{y}[i]$, where $\\mathbf{x}[i : i + m]$ is a patch of $\\mathbf{x}$ with size $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is repeated like in a sliding window approach to get all the output elements. The following figure provides an example with $\\mathbf{x} = (3,2,1,7,1,2,5,4)$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ = ($\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}, 1, \\frac{1}{4}$) so that the first three output elements are computed:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see in the preceding example that the padding size is zero ($p = 0$). Notice that the rotated filter wr is shifted by two cells each time we shift. This shift is another hyperparameter of a convolution, the stride $s$. In this example, the **stride is two**, $s = 2$. Note that the stride has to be a positive number smaller than the size of the input vector $\\mathbf{x}$ (pause and answer why?). We'll talk more about padding and strides in the next section!"

    "### The effect of zero-padding in a convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "So far here, we've used zero-padding in convolutions to compute finite-sized output vectors. Technically, padding can be applied with any $p\\ge0$. Depending on the choice $p$, boundary cells may be treated differently than the cells located in the middle of $\\mathbf{x}$.   \n",

    "Now consider an example where $n = 5$ (number of elements in $\\mathbf{x}$), $m = 3$ (number of elements in $\\mathbf{w}$. Then, $p = 0$, $\\mathbf{x}[0]$ is only used in computing one output element (for instance, $\\mathbf{y}[0]$), while $\\mathbf{x}[1]$ is used in the computation of two output elements (for   instance, $\\mathbf{y}[0]$ and $\\mathbf{y}[1]$). So, you can see that this different treatment of elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ can artificially put more emphasis on the middle element, $\\mathbf{x}[2]$ , since it has appeared in most computations. We can avoid this issue if we choose $p = 2$, in which case, each element of $\\mathbf{x}$ will be involved in\n",
    "computing three elements of $\\mathbf{y}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the size of the output $\\mathbf{y}$ also depends on the choice of the padding strategy we use. There are three modes of padding that are commonly used in practice: **full**, **same**, and **valid**:\n",
    "\n",
    "• In the **full mode**, the padding parameter $p$ is set to $p = m - 1$. Full padding increases the dimensions of the output; thus, it is rarely used in convolutional neural network architectures. An increasing dimension has problems with control of architectures and generalization (as it tends to overfit).\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Same padding** is usually used if you want to have the size of the output ($\\mathbf{y}$) the same as the input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. In this case, the padding parameter $p$ is computed according to the filter size, along with the requirement that the input size and output size are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Finally, computing a convolution in the **valid mode** refers to the case where $p = 0$ (no padding).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the three different padding modes for a simple $5 \\times 5$ pixel input with a kernel size of $3 \\times 3$ and a stride of $1$:\n",

    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The most commonly used padding mode in convolutional neural networks is **same padding**. One of its advantages over the other padding modes is that same padding preserves the height and width of the input images or tensors, which makes designing a network architecture more convenient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One big disadvantage of the valid padding versus full and same padding, for example, is that the volume of the tensors would decrease substantially in neural networks with many layers, which can be detrimental to the network performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is recommended that you preserve the spatial size using same padding for the convolutional layers and  decrease the spatial size via pooling layers instead (*kapit lang/hold on, we will learn this in Section 3 below!*). As for the full padding, its size results in an output larger than the input size. Full padding is usually used in signal processing applications where it is important to minimize  boundary effects. **However, in deep learning context, boundary effect is not usually an issue**, so we rarely see full padding."

    "## 2.2 Performing a discrete convolution in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts you learned in the previous sections are easily extendible to two dimensions. When we deal with two dimensional input, such as a matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{n1×n2}$ and the filter matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{m1×m2}$, where $m_1 \\leq n_1$ and $m_2 \\leq n_2$ , then the matrix $\\mathbf{Y}$ = $\\mathbf{X} * \\mathbf{W}$ is the result of 2D convolution of $\\mathbf{X}$ with $\\mathbf{W}$. This is mathematically defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{Y}= \\mathbf{X} * \\mathbf{W} \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{Y}[i, j]= \\sum_{k_1=-\\infty}^{k_2=\\infty}\\sum_{k_2=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{X} [i-k_1, j-k_2] \\mathbf{W}[k_1, k_2]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if you omit one of the dimensions, the remaining formula is exactly the same as the one we used previously to compute the convolution in 1D. In fact, all the previously mentioned techniques, such as zero-padding, rotating the filter matrix, and the use of strides, are also applicable to 2D convolutions, provided that they are extended to both the dimensions independently. The following example illustrates the computation of a 2D convolution between an input matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{3×3}$, a kernel matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{3×3}$, padding $p = (1, 1)$, and stride $s = (2, 2)$. According to the specified padding, one layer of zeros are padded on each side of the input matrix, which results in the padded matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{5×5}^{padded}$, as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this rotation is not the same as the transpose matrix. To get the rotated filter in NumPy, we can write W_rot=W[::-1,::-1]. Next, we can shift the rotated filter matrix along the padded input matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ padded like a sliding window and compute the sum of the element-wise product, which is denoted by the dot operator in the\n",

    "# 3. Subsampling or Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsampling is typically applied in two forms of pooling operations in convolutional neural networks: **max-pooling** and **mean-pooling** (also known as **average-pooling**). Here, max-pooling takes the maximum value from a neighborhood of pixels, and mean-pooling computes their average. The pooling layer is usually denoted by $\\mathbf{P}_{n1×n2}$. Here, the subscript determines the size of the neighborhood (the number of adjacent pixels in each dimension), where the max or mean operation is performed. We refer to such a neighborhood as the pooling size.\n",

    "The advantage of pooling are two-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pooling (max-pooling) introduces **some local invariance**. This means that small changes in a local neighborhood do not change the result of max-pooling. Therefore, it helps **generate features that are more robust to noise** in the input data. See the following example that shows max-pooling of two different input matrices $\\mathbf{X}_1$ and $\\mathbf{X}_2$ results in the same output.     \n",

    "So far, we've learned about the basic building blocks of convolutional neural networks. The concepts illustrated in this chapter are not really more difficult than traditional multilayer neural networks. Intuitively, we can say that the most important operation in a traditional neural network is the matrix-vector multiplication. For instance, we use matrix-vector multiplications to pre-activations (or net input) as in $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + b$. Here, $\\mathbf{x}$ is a column vector representing pixels, and $\\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix connecting the pixel inputs to each hidden unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional neural network, this operation is replaced by a convolution operation, as in $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X} + b$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is a matrix representing the pixels in a height $x$ width arrangement. In both cases, the pre-activations are passed to an activation function to obtain the activation of a hidden unit $\\mathbf{H}$ =$ \\Phi(\\mathbf{A})$, where $\\Phi$ is the activation function. Furthermore, recall that subsampling is another building block of a convolutional neural network, which may appear in the form of pooling, as we described in the previous section.\n",

    "Below are some common definitions that are necessary to know and understand to correctly utilize Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample**: one element of a dataset.   \n",
    "- **Example**: one image is a sample in a convolutional network   \n",
    "- **Example**: one audio file is a sample for a speech recognition model   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch**: a set of N samples. The samples in a batch are processed independently, in parallel. If training, a batch results in only one update to the model.   \n",
    "A batch generally approximates the distribution of the input data better than a single input. The larger the batch, the better the approximation; however, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will still result in only one update. For inference (evaluate/predict), it is recommended to pick a batch size that is as large as you can afford without going out of memory (since larger batches will usually result in faster evaluating/prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch**: an arbitrary cutoff, generally defined as \"one pass over the entire dataset\", used to separate training into distinct phases, which is useful for logging and periodic evaluation. When using evaluation_data or evaluation_split with the fit method of Keras models, evaluation will be run at the end of every epoch.  "
